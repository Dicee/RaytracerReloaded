RaytracerReloaded
=================

It was initially a student project to build a simple raytracer with a Swing UI. Since this was at the very beginning of my java adventure, 
the code was clumsy although it worked fine.

I decided to rebuild it from scratch, particularly the UI part. The following features will be included :

- XML import/export of scenes
- realistic 3D scenes processing using the ray tracing algorithm
- textured objects (spheres, parallelepipeds, flat surfaces, meshed surfaces)
- animation mode enabling to create animated gif (in a first time)
- UI features allowing to create and modify the scene (show/hide objects, resize, translate, rotate...)
- UI features allowing to create the movie (set the animations, their duration...)

As it is on my leisure time, it could take a moment before I finish.
